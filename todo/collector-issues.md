# Collector.js Issues

## 1. OpenAI Synthesis Not Implemented
- **Location**: `collector.js`
- **Issue**: AI synthesis remains a placeholder; no API call/logic yet
- **Impact**: End-to-end memo generation is incomplete

## 2. Observability (enhance)
- **Location**: pipeline/logging
- **Issue**: Per-repo stats and artifacts added; consider adding error codes and warn/error counts
- **Impact**: Easier to pinpoint slow repos; still can add richer summaries if needed
