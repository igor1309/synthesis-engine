# Collector.js Implementation (archived)

Most of this plan has been implemented (see docs/Log.md 2025-09-13). The notes below are kept for context; new work should be tracked in top-priorities.

## Follow-ups
- Optional: streaming synthesis path and richer prompt controls.
- Optional: extract a `src/pipeline/run` shim and narrow `collector.js` to CLI only.

## Observability & Artifacts
- Implemented: run-summary.json, step summary, artifacts snapshot.
