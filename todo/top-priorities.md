# Top Priorities (Detailed)

1) Config polish and security (remaining)
- Why
  - Close the loop on docs and safety for varied environments.
- Scope
  - Add a precedence matrix to docs/Config.md (CLI > env > defaults) with examples.
  - Expand redaction tests to cover run-summary.settings and step summary content.
  - Add proxy/GHE troubleshooting notes with examples.
- Deliverables
  - Config.md updates and a small redaction test addition.
- Acceptance
  - Docs clearly show precedence and proxy/GHE setup; redaction test covers settings.
