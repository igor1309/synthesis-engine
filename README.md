# Synthesis Engine

**Synthesis Engine** collects markdown from each repoâ€™s inbox, compiles a single context.md, and uses the OpenAI API to produce a verifiable synthesis_memo.md. The memo contains **Part 1: Objective Synthesis** (sourced themes & links) and **Part 2: Critical Analysis** (conflicts, counter-arguments and weaknesses) for easy review and follow-up.
