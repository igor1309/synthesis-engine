Here’s a cleaned, polished version that keeps every point and constraint you wrote — just clearer and typo-fixed:

I have a habit of building small, AI-assisted applications on weekends. These apps always involve AI in some way.

For example, I created a workflow: I send interesting messages to a Telegram bot, set up automation to fetch updates from this bot at regular intervals, use AI to generate a summary of each message, extract tags and a title, save the message together with the summary, tags, and title into a folder, and then send a list of summaries back to Telegram. This thing is useful and enjoyable, and I feel good about having it every day.

I typically spend 6–10 hours per weekend.

A project can be a pre-MVP with potential for expansion on future weekends, or a self-contained tiny utility completed over a single weekend; either way, I aim to release each week.

I am the primary consumer — some small amount of scaling is fine, but scaling is not the goal.

I’m not keen on services like Vercel or Render because of potential vendor lock-in.

AI should be a core, or at least an essential, part of the project.

I have no strict preference for language or tech stack; I like to use these projects as an opportunity to learn outside my core domain of iOS development.

Swift is my native language; with AI coding assistants I can work in any language. I already have experience building backend and web applications; I use Docker and related tools, so I’m an easy and eager learner.

My main challenge is coming up with good ideas for such small projects. They often end up either too big for a weekend project (I’m a working dad) or too trivial and uninteresting to sustain curiosity and motivation.

I need your help here. Let’s begin with a Q&A session so you can gather relevant information about me and my interests before presenting and discussing ideas.
