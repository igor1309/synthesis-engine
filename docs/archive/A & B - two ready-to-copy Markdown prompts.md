Below are two **ready-to-copy** Markdown prompts.  
- **Prompt A** — generate exactly **7 concise** weekend-sprint ideas (one sentence each) + a one-sentence verification why each cannot be solved by prompting alone.  
- **Prompt B** — expand a chosen subset from Prompt A into **full, timeboxed sprint plans** (1–3 weekends), with exact fields.  

Copy each prompt separately into an LLM as needed.
