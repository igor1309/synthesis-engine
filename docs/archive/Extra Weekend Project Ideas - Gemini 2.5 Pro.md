# Extra Weekend Project Ideas - Gemini 2.5 Pro

1.  **Knowledge Graph Weaver:** Ingests your notes and articles to build and visualize a graph database of interconnected concepts, technologies, and people, revealing hidden relationships. This requires a persistent graph database and an interactive visualization layer, which cannot be managed or rendered by a single, stateless prompt.

2.  **Cross-Domain Analogy Engine:** Analyzes your collected notes from different domains (e.g., iOS, backend) to find and explain analogous concepts, accelerating cross-disciplinary learning. This relies on a pre-processing pipeline to classify documents into distinct domains before performing targeted, comparative analysis between the separated data sets.

3.  **Project Trajectory Narrator:** Watches a Git repository, using an LLM to summarize commit diffs and issue changes into a high-level, evolving story of the project's progress. This needs continuous integration with the Git version control system and state management to process new commits incrementally over time.

4.  **Personalized Debate Bot:** Creates two AI agents that use your notes to debate a topic from opposing viewpoints, helping you explore arguments and uncover gaps in your knowledge. This requires a multi-agent framework to orchestrate a stateful, turn-based conversation, which a single prompt cannot manage.

5.  **YouTube Curriculum Architect:** Ingests a YouTube playlist, fetches transcripts, uses AI to cluster videos by core concepts, and generates a structured, text-based learning path. This necessitates a multi-step data pipeline involving API calls, data extraction, and an unsupervised clustering algorithm to group the content.

6.  **Serendipity Bot:** A daemon that scans your knowledge base for older, "forgotten" notes or code snippets and sends you a daily summary explaining their potential relevance now. This requires a scheduled background process and file system access to autonomously select and process documents without direct user initiation.

7.  **Idea-to-Spec Converter:** Takes a one-line project idea, performs a vector search across your notes and code for relevant context, and generates a structured project brief. This requires implementing a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ground the output in your specific, indexed personal documents.
