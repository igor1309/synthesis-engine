1. Error Handling:Add continue-on-error: false or custom error handling for the script step to notify on failure.
2. Dependency Caching:Use actions/cache for node_modules to improve speed and efficiency.

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles(‘**/package-lock.json’) }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```
 3. Branch Targeting:Ensure the workflow only pushes to the intended branch (trunk). Optionally, add a check to avoid accidental pushes to other branches.
4. Test Step (Optional):Consider adding a test step after installing dependencies to verify the environment before running the script.
